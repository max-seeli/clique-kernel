    "## Modular Product of Graphs\n",
    "The modular product of two graphs is a concept in graph theory that involves combining two graphs, G and H, into a single graph. This product has specific applications, particularly in subgraph isomorphism problems. The construction of the modular product graph follows this definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "The vertex set of the modular product is the Cartesian product of the vertex sets of the two graphs. For any two vertices $(u, v)$ and $(u', v')$ in the modular product, there is an edge between them if and only if $u$ is different from $u'$ and $v$ is different from $v'$ and either:\n",
    "- **Cond. 1**: $u$ and $u'$ are adjacent in the first graph and $v$ and $v'$ are adjacent in the second graph, or\n",
    "- **Cond. 2**: $u$ and $u'$ are not adjacent in the first graph and $v$ and $v'$ are not adjacent in the second graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Modular}(G, H) = (V_{\\text{mod}}, E_{\\text{mod}}) \\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application\n",
    "The modular product of two graphs transforms the subgraph isomorphism problem into clique-finding problem. The construction of the modular product allows the equality of the existence of a clique with the isomorphism of the induced subgraphs (from the nodes contained in the clique) of $G$ and $H$.\n",
